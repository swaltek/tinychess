# minimal_react_app
My attempt at configuring a react app from scratch.
## usage
- Run `npm install` to install the required libraries
  - Then you can use `npm run dev` to run serve a copy of your app to `localhost:8080` as you develop
- Run `npm run build` to build the project for your production.
